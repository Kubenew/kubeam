Kubeam looks for security issues in Kubernetes clusters. The tool was intended to improve Kubernetes security awareness and visibility.
Kubescan is a multi-cloud solution that scans for sick nodes, pods, and containers in a kubernetes cluster for ransomware immutability or anomaly detection, possibly with visibility for security vulnerabilities, making kubernetes troubleshooting easier. I've worked on Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.
Installation of kubectl is required.
